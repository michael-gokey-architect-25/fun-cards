      "id": 21,
      "front": "What happens if the Daily Scrum reveals new work is needed to achieve the Sprint Goal?",

    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "front": "Why is it important that Increments are \"potentially releasable\"?",

      "category": "Scrum Artifacts",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "front": "How does timeboxing events help with empiricism?",
      "back": "Timeboxing creates regular inspection and adaptation points, limits waste, focuses discussions, creates a rhythm for the team, and ensures that the time dedicated to planning is proportionate to the length of the Sprint.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "id": 31,
      "front": "What is the recommended approach when multiple teams work on the same product?",

    {
      "id": 33,
      "front": "What is the purpose of a Definition of Done when scaling Scrum?",
      "back": "A shared Definition of Done ensures consistency in quality across all teams working on the product, enables integration of work from multiple teams, and creates transparency about what \"complete\" means.",

      "id": 36,
      "front": "What is the purpose of estimating Product Backlog items?",
      "back": "Estimates help with forecasting, provide a sense of size and complexity for prioritization, highlight potential risks or unknowns, and aid in Sprint Planning decisions.",

      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 37,
      "front": "What is a typical format for a Product Backlog item?",
      "back": "While formats vary, common elements include a description (often as a user story), acceptance criteria, size estimate, value indication, and dependencies or notes. User stories often follow the format \"As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]\".",
      "category": "Product Backlog",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 38,
      "front": "How often should Product Backlog refinement occur?",
      "back": "Refinement is ongoing and typically consumes no more than 10% of the Developers' capacity. Teams often hold dedicated refinement sessions in addition to continuous refinement.",

      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 39,
      "front": "How detailed should Product Backlog items be?",
      "back": "Items near the top (likely to be selected in the upcoming Sprint) should be small and detailed enough to be completed in one Sprint. Items further down can be larger and less detailed.",

    },
    {
      "id": 40,
      "front": "Who participates in Product Backlog refinement?",
      "back": "The Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers) participates, with the Product Owner having decision authority on content and ordering. Subject matter experts or stakeholders may be invited when needed.",

      "id": 41,
      "front": "How does the concept of \"velocity\" relate to Sprint Planning?",
      "back": "Velocity—the average amount of work completed in previous Sprints—can be used as a reference for forecasting how much work can be accomplished in the upcoming Sprint, helping make realistic commitments.",
      "category": "Sprint Planning",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },

      "id": 43,
      "front": "What is the difference between commitment and forecast in Scrum?",
      "back": "The Developers commit to the Sprint Goal (the objective) but forecast the specific Product Backlog items they believe they can complete. The forecast may change as more is learned during the Sprint.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "id": 44,
      "front": "How should a team handle a situation when stakeholders pressure them to take more work than their capacity?",
      "back": "The Scrum Team should maintain transparency about their capacity, explain the negative impacts of overcommitment on quality and sustainability, use data from past Sprints to forecast realistically, and potentially negotiate scope or requirements.",
      "category": "Sprint Planning",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "id": 45,
      "front": "What is the relationship between the Sprint Goal and selected Product Backlog items?",
      "back": "The Sprint Goal provides coherence and purpose to the selected items. If some items prove harder than expected, the Developers can negotiate with the Product Owner about the scope of selected items while still preserving the Sprint Goal.",
      "category": "Sprint Planning",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 46,
      "front": "How does the Scrum value of \"Focus\" manifest in daily work?",
      "back": "Through concentrating on the Sprint Goal, limiting work in progress, minimizing multitasking, protecting the team from external disruptions, and dedicating efforts to completing work rather than starting new work.",

      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 47,
      "front": "How does the Scrum value of \"Openness\" impact team performance?",

    },
    {
      "id": 48,

    },
    {
      "id": 49,
      "front": "How can a team balance individual accountability with collective responsibility?",
      "back": "By recognizing that while individual team members complete specific tasks, the entire team owns the delivery of the Increment, supporting each other, swarming on problems, sharing knowledge, and collectively committing to the Sprint Goal.",

      "id": 50,
      "front": "How do Scrum Teams evolve through the stages of team development?",
      "back": "They typically progress through forming (orientation), storming (conflict), norming (establishing practices), and performing (high productivity) stages. The Scrum framework provides structure through this evolution with regular events, clear accountabilities, and guided empiricism.",
